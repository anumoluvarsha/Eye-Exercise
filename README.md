# Eye-Exercise
1) In this project, we have 2 eyes on the screens which look at the directions where the mouse is at that instant. As we move the mouse, both the eyes follow the mouse movement using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

2) <h>How to run :</h>

   <body>Clone this repository on to the local system and then run it through VS Code on a window on the local host. Then move the mouse on the screen to test the                 project.</body>

3) <h>Future Improvements :</h>

    <body>Right now, the code creates two eyes on the screen and follows the mouse movement. I can try to implement events on click of the mouse and also on leave of             the mouse.</body>
